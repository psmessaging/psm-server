====================README=======================

psm-server does NOT have a standard open source license and is limited to non-commercial use.  All rights are reserved by the author and owner of this project and a written license is required for people who want to integrate it with a commercial project.  Please read the LICENSE.txt for more information...


DESCRIPTION:

The psm-server project supports social network clients that want to have stealth messages/locations/photos placed on their social network wall or checkins.  It also has some limited SMS support.  There is also an Android psm client (psm-android) example that goes along with the psm-server.


PURPOSE:

If you have a Social Network client application, this allows for a private stealth message, that only users of the psmessaging service can see.  This psm-server allows you to implement the process in your application, but is limited to non-commercial use.  You very well might end up creating a side by side social network, that slowly moves users from one social network to another through this psmessaging service.  There are many possible uses for this, but the intended use is to allow private messaging across a social network that is built into a 3rd party social network client.


COMMERCIAL USE:
PSM-SERVER AND IT'S FORKS ARE NOT FOR COMMERCIAL USE.


LICENSING:

There is a STRICT license for private use and/or commercial use.  Please read the LICENSE.txt for full details, but psm-server is NOT open source.  This is the code to allow you to integrate it with your small scale applications to evaluate it before using it for commercial use, which is not free.
